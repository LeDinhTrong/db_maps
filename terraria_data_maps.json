    "description": "Tired of having to create structures with grandeur design that takes forever to build? Just want to hop in action and slay eldritch horrors beyond mortal comprehension? Look no further!\n\nThis map was made with Calamity Infernum, Remnants and Apachii's Classes Mod and it's purely untouched. You can choose not to install Apachii's Classes mod, but there may be some unloaded pink tiles here and there caused by the Lost Rune Fragment tile. Forgot to turn it off while making this world, sorry about that: As for the teleportation hub in the treehouse section, I only added a sky arena. Feel free to make your own arena.\nRegardless, most of the buildings are from other map mods here in Curse Forge such as Ultirarria and Christmas Village (credits to both v0id585 and BlueJay_T_Gaming for the wonderful structures). Suffice to say, this world has every Calamity essentials generated (Sunken sea, Hallowed Garden, Planetoids, and even Vernal Soil biome added by yours truly). Have fun!\n\nOPTIONAL: \nAlso, Magic Storage is included, located beneath the church. I also made an alternate map that doesn't have any Magic Storage in case that you don't have it installed. You can choose not to use the Magic Storage mod, but I highly recommend it given how many items Calamity has, or Stars Above, if that's up to your speed.",

    "description": "This is a Skyblock survival map with added Shimmer. You only start with a chest with one Jungle seed and that's it! It is highly recommended to play as a Mediumcore player in order to progress unless playing in Journey mode. It is possible to progress as a Classic Character but it is extremally grindy at the start. There is a Demon Alter 377 blocks straight down. The \"Dungeon\" is 1,297 blocks to the east and the Lihzahrd Alter is 764 blocks west and 369 blocks down. Good luck!\n\nTips:\nSimply throw your copper items into the shimmer and collect the copper ore and wood. Jump off and die to reset your tools and repeat. You can turn the ore and wood into stone and dirt as well\nMaking housing out of stone is faster than gathering wood\nOnce you have a house and 50 silver coins, you can buy anvils from the Merchant for iron equipment\nMake an iron bucket and head down to the Underworld to gather lava from Lava Slimes and turn that into a bucket of water to unlock fishing as well as making a Jungle with those seeds\nOnce you defeat the Eye of Cthulhu you can buy Grass seeds and acorns from the Dryad\nTurn potions into bottles and then into sand. You can make a Sandgun from turning mining potions into ingredients for Antlion Mandibles and getting topaz from Gem Bunnies or Squirrels\nTo get the Angler you will need at least 3 sandblocks in a 1x3 pattern and just a little bit of water for him to spawn",

Terraria being a very different game from Undertale makes this map deviate in terms of gameplay. There are parkour challenges as oppose to standard puzzles like the ones seen in Undertale and the map has a metroidvania feel to it as well. This map is in the middle of development and content will keep being added even when the map is completed as a modded version and \"Hard Mode\" versions of the map must be added and zipped along with the original map.

The entire tree counts as valid housing, was designed to and can fit all of the NPC's, has a teleport system for easy travel, and large enough to be safe from blood moon spawns. The entrances are controlled by buttons only players can activate. Crimson should not be able to spread to it. Most of the game's crafting stations are present and most rooms feature their own furniture set - players can choose to remove if desired. It is insulated from meteors with cloud islands above (not pictured).\nVery little other modification was done to this map except for some landscaping/coloring. The map has a pyramid, hidden sword shrine, and plenty of giant living trees/cloud islands. Check below the tree for a root that goes down to some mine cart tracks to get started underground.\nEnjoy exploring!",

When you toss any item into the Shimmer, it undergoes a magical transformation. It can either be converted into a unique item or be deconstructed to yield essential resources that are vital for your progress. Utilize this mechanic wisely to maximize your chances of success.\nAdditionally, this map incorporates the \"Get fixed boy\" seed mechanic, a new addition to Terraria. By utilizing this seed, you can expect an increased level of difficulty, making your journey even more challenging.

    "description": "What is a \"skyblock\" map?  It's a map where you start on an incredibly small \"floating island\" surrounded by void.  It may have a tree or water or lava on it, or it may literally just be dirt.  Often there are other small islands with different resources that you have to build to.  Why do people play skyblocks?  If you like a game, but are bored of it, a skyblock brings a fresh experience and new way to play.  It's also incredibly satisfying to start with nothing and build a whole world yourself, the way you want it to be.\nSo what makes Brutal Skyblock different and better than the other maps?\n\t\tIt's harder.  You have to face real challenges even before you start fishing... unless you chose Baby Mode.\n\t\tIt's easier too.  What?  The second island let's you select your skyblock difficulty: Baby, Veteran, or Brutal Legend.  It's 3 totally different maps in one!\n\t\tCompletionism.  All bosses, events, NPC's, biomes, accessories, armor, traps, and 99% of weapons can be gotten in this map.\n\t\tMobile compatible.  I use mobile map files.  When loaded on PC, the game just silently updates them.  No issues.\n\t\tMultiplayer friendly.  I give out just a little bit extra of certain non-renewable resources to make the map \"comfortable\" for about 4 players.\n\t\tTiny! The world uses a crazy custom 2,000x800 block world size. About 1/2 the size of a small world.",

Bring peace back to the land of Hyrule and save the princess Zelda!\n\n12 Simple Rules - Create a new Journey Mode Character\n1. Throw away your starting items, including Journey Mode wings and turn off Increased Placement Range.\n2. You can only buy ammo, potions and throwable items like Shurikens from the vendors.\n3. Player one should always grab the chest from the bottom center when four chests are in a triangle.\n4. If there are two or more signs next to each other, always read left to right. Golden Tombstones should always be read.\n5. Do not take the clothes off mannequins.\n6. Weapons and potions dropped from enemies and bosses can be used except for Rope. Do not use Rope of any kind.\n7. Crafting is allowed, like crafting Mana Crystals from Fallen Stars. Find workbenches, tinker's workshops, etc. in Mundus Village.\n8. No placing blocks, except after defeating the Eye of Cthulhu where instructed to.\n9. No breaking blocks, except in Ganondorf's Lair with the explosives given.\n10. Read the signs carefully, as they point you in the proper direction and sometimes hint at secrets.\n11. Research the Large Gems, as a safeguard, as they can be lost easily. Duplicate the Large Gems for their corresponding Gem Locks for upgrades and secrets! No other research/duplication should be done.\n12. In Journey Mode, set the enemy difficulty to Classic or higher.\nMultiplayer\nUp to 4 players can coop through the adventure in Journey Mode!\nThe rules are the same as the single player rules.",

It has all of the loot you would expect to find within a dungeon, as well as an additional fishing pond, and safe area to set your spawn point. The entrance has been completely customized, but will still spawn the cultists in hardmode. The dungeon itself has unique challenges within it, as well as a half dozen secret areas. You can make it as easy or difficult as you'd like by mining and placing blocks, or trying the challenges without changing the dungeon. Explore, and have fun!",

    "description": "- Added an ocean cave.\n- Made the sword shrine have a chest with both the sword and Terragrim.\n- Added an extra chamber below the pyramid with the missing items from the chest.\n- Added a graveyard, for Biome completeness and for hardcore characters.\n- Added all Moss types. (NOTE Tedit did not handle Moss well, so I am not 100% sure this is working. I added all the moss types in a long line below the snow Biome If you wanted to know where to find them.)\n- I added all Ore types both pre and post Hardmode. I did the pre-hardmode ores by mass replacing ore types in huge 200x200 lines spanning the whole map. Some are straight lines down, some are horizontal sections. The ores are pretty close to 50:50 each, but Copper and Tin are the closest, only a few 100 difference overall. Once in Hardmode, since the world counts as \"Drunk\" (NOTE The base seed is NOT a drunk seed. I changed to Drunk after initial world gen) as altars are broken you will get all 6 ore types.\n- Added a few more Demon Altars to help get more ore types given you are getting 6 HM ore types vs 3.\n- I added the removed Heart Shrine micro Biome in the Snow Biome, why? Because why not.\n- Made one of the beehives larger than the rest.\n- Speaking of Crimson, I added a Crimson chest with proper items into the Dungeon.\n- Speaking of the Dungeon, made 3 colors preset in the world, replaced all items in each section with the proper brick,background, items, etc. I also added a bit of extra brick and background in some places, so if you want to build an arena in a certain color type, you should have plenty of space to do so.\n- I added tons more temple traps, ~100 Spiky ball traps, ~25 Spear traps, ~10 flame traps.\n- I made sure every chest item was spawned into the world at least once.\n- I added every painting. (NOTE I am not 100% sure, Tedit updated mid way through my progress and it made placing sprites way harder, and I couldn't find paintings anymore. Because of this ONLY the Dungeon has the paintings on the wall placed by me. For the Desert and Underground paintings, I added at least 1 of each one to a chest. So between the naturally spawned paintings and my added ones, every painting Should be in the game. Underworld paintings as far as I could count all spawned naturally.) (SIDE NOTE. Speaking of underworld only about half the chest items spawned naturally with world gen, I added the rest in by hand.)\n- I added a few missing banners.\n-  And finally I added every naturally occurring statue. (NOTE as with paintings, this changed mid way, so I am not 100% sure I got them all.) I will say the 1 Heart Statue that I placed, is in the Heart Shrine in the snow Biome.\n- Added Moonlord pants to a chest somewhere in the world\n- Added a few Red Potions to some chests throughout the world ",

They are only accessible through game modification software like inventory editors and tools like Terraria Tweaker, the latter which prevents automatic in-game removal of unobtainable items. Features may also be labeled as unobtainable due to being only partially obtainable\nUnimplemented refers to features that are only partially present in the game files. Due to incomplete coding, being replaced by another feature (such as another item), or forced deletion, they cannot be accessed in-game, even with software like inventory editors. The only exception to this inaccessibility is the Boring Bow, which can be placed in the inventory.\nRemoved refers to features that have been completely removed from the game for various reasons, ranging from copyright liability to former-exclusivity. There is no longer any data related to them present in the game's files, and their Data IDs are typically replaced by something else.",

    "description": "Let's combine two popular games and have some Counter Strike-style fun with Terraria's game mechanics? The task of the map is simple, but not without peculiarities. The terrorists must get to the dungeon, kill the Skeletron and find the Mechanic in the Dungeon, buy wires and a wrench, and then try to connect a lever near the tower to explosives and, accordingly, blow up this tower.It's simple, right? The Counter-Terrarists have a simpler task, but no less important - while the Terrarists make their little journey for copper cable to hand it over to a collection point for non-ferrous metals by the wires to the Mechanic in Dungeon, the Counter-Terrarians must prepare to meet the “guests”. How the preparations will take place - it all depends on your imagination and the time that you will have from the beginning of the game to the moment of meeting.\n\nThe card is designed for the number of players from two to eight people. Best of all, of course, eight, since there are 4 classes in the game and the most interesting game will turn out just with the full complement.\n\nPlayer Classes:\n\tDemoman\n\tattack plane\n\tSniper\n\tHeavy infantry",
